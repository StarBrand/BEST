## Brenda Enzyme Searcher Tool

The enzymes are a complex group of proteins, which are essential for most biological processes in living systems. This characteristic gives them great potential in biotechnological applications.

Currently, the most whole enzyme database worldwide is  BRaunschweig ENzyme DAtabase (BRENDA), which has 104,000 enzymes names with their functional parameters and other properties. BRENDA allows access to this information. However, the inteface is complex and the data is hard to aggregate.

BEST is a versatile web tool that enables querying enzymes and proteins in the BRENDA database fast and efficiently. This tool allows you to obtain functional parameters and molecular properties from your enzyme query in a user-friendly format. This tool was developed in Shiny R.
