            To start looking in Brenda, we need your Brenda account (why?). 
            If you do not have one, you can visit: 
            <a href="https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/register.php">Brenda Registration</a>
            Once you have your account, we can look for the enzymes you need 
            and the numerical parameters you request.

          <h2>Enzyme query</h2>
          <p>
            To get the enzymes you need, we offer three different kind of options. This inputs are in 
            the 
            <a id="enzymeHelp" href="#" class="action-button">select enzyme</a>
            section.

          <h3>EC Number</h3>
          <p>
            Enzymes are classified by the 
            <a href="https://iubmb.org/">IUBMB</a>
             according to the reaction they catalize. This corresponds to the
            EC Number, which is a four number code, with the first one indicating the subclass 
            such as oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases and translocases. 
            The second number indicates the functional group of reaction, the third indicates an specific 
            type of molecule and the fourth the last
            level and the reaction itself. More info: 
            <a href="https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iubmb/">EC number</a>
            <br/>
            If you know the EC number of your enzyme of interest, indicate it in the input
            shown in the next image:

          <h3>Enzyme name</h3>
          <p>
            Enzymes have a lot of names that differ depending on the gen codifiding it, the reaction, 
            historical reasons and so on. Brenda groups them according to its ec number, however, they are associated
            to the multiple names in which they are called in literature. This category is showed in the 
            <a>Brenda web page</a>
            with the name 'Synonyms'.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the length of the list, that contains every synonym of every type of enzyme on the database, this names 
            are separeted in subclasses. Then, if you know just a particular name of your enzyme, first you have to
             know in which of this categories it is: 
          </p>
          <img src="Tutorial(2).jpg" width="250px" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
          <p>
            For the next step you have to select the functional group that is involved in the catalyzed 
            reaction, such as: 
          </p>
          <img src="Tutorial(3).jpg" width="250px" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
          <p>
            In the follow space, you can type the name of the enzyme you know. You can search for the list 
            below, remembering that it is a long list. This selector autocompletes your input and shows the posible 
            names that are registered in the Brenda database, select the one that fits most with the name you know.
          </p>
          <img src="Tutorial(4).jpg" width="250px" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"/>
          <p>
            After you press the search button, a short list of posible type of enzyme is going to be shown (it can be 
            just one). The selector shown the ec number and the Brenda recommended name. Select the one you are looking 
            for, press 'go', and go on with the numerical parameter selector.
