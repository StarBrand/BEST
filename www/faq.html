                            The query is made by 
                            <a href="https://www.brenda-enzymes.org/soap.php" target="_blank">Brenda SOAP</a>
                             which requires a Brenda account. Because of the possibility of more than one query at the same time 
                            we use the personal account for that.

                            The Brenda is used just to make every query. We also defines your user to separete your generated tables 
                            from other tables. But, we can access your password for anything else. If you doubt it, you can see the 
                            Java code that make every query: 
                            <a href="https://github.com/StarBrand/BrendaSOAP" target="_blank">Brenda SOAP Github repository</a>
                            To make it clear, if we could access to your password and Brenda account for personal use, we would only be able 
                            to request a change of password (but cannot changing without your mail) and make queries in Brenda.
